Each top level archive file currently contains three things:

1. Data pack
2. Sprites pack
3. Strings

Data pack contains various gameplay data for the engine to consume, and is
similar to the format used in Tamagotchi Smart, with some expansions for
downloadable items.

Sprites pack is described [here](/formats/sprites.md).

Strings is another archive, containing nine string tables, which I'll document
at some point.

The same structure is used for both the built-in game data and for downloadable
items.
